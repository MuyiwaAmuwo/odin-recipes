<h1>Chakalaka Recipe</h1>

<img src="../images/chakalaka.jpeg" alt="Finished Egunsi Soup">

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Chakalaka is a South African vegetable relish,[1] usually spicy, that is traditionally served with bread, pap, samp, stews, or curries. Chakalaka may have originated in the townships of Johannesburg or on the gold mines surrounding Johannesburg, when Mozambican mineworkers coming off shift cooked tinned produce (tomatoes, beans) with chili to produce a spicy Portuguese-style relish to accompany pap. Many variations of chakalaka exist, depending on region and family tradition. Some versions include beans, cabbage and butternut.[2] For example, canned baked beans, canned tomatoes, onion, garlic, and curry paste can be used to make the dish.[3]
